# Hey there, I'm Oliver! 👋

- 🔭 Known here as **@SurvivalDome**.
- 🎮 Super passionate about **video games**.
- 🎬 Big fan of old-school **Star Wars** and old-school **Marvel** (by old-school I really mean, before what horror it has become now).
- 💡 **Technology enthusiast**, whether it's the newest gadget or vintage tech.
- 📚 On the academic front, I'm deeply into **maths** and **physics**.
- 🖥️ Coding-wise, I'm intermediate-advanced (I think) in **C++** and **C#**, I'm also a beginner in **Rust**. I'm aspiring to master **Java, Javascript,** and **Python**. Why? Idk, those are just **THE** programming languages from what I'm aware
- 🌐 I'm making a game engine following a tutorial made by **The Cherno** You can check out his tutorial over [here!](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno) And I thought I might as well upload it to GitHub, just to learn how to upload things to GitHub!
- 📫 Reach out to me [here](mailto:oliverroberts0@outlook.com).

## P.S.
- Just because I say I like these things, doesn't mean I know very much about them 🤣
